## Lend-sqr assessment feedback by Awowole Hammad Olamilekan

### Tech stack
The primary tech stack utilized is **React**, a JavaScript framework suitable for designing both simple and intricate web applications.

### There are four figma design assigned to be done
    - The login page
    - The dashboard
    - The user page and lastly
    - The user details page

### The login page
- This the page where the user can login after successfully sign up, in this particular design, i assumed that the user already sign up with an email: test@gmail.com and password test123@.
- I setup a logic that only when the user login with the correct credentials should he be navigated to the dashboard otherwise an alert should pop out "Invalid user details".

### React hooks
- React hooks such as useState, useEffect was used in managing the state of the web application

### The dashboard
    - This was divided into three components, the header, the sideboard and the userboard.
    - The dasbboard was breakdown into some components because of:
        - code readability
        - code reuseability

- The UserData file is where i fetched the data from an API generated from json-generator.com then mocked the response body using Mocki.io as instructed in the instruction attached to the assessment question.
- I used asyn-await to fetch the data from the API as this enable the removal of .then() callbacks and in turns return an asynchronous resolved data. i used the async-await function to wait for the promise.
- The data fetch was dynamically rendered and displayed.

### Challenges face
- I submitted this assessment late due to
    - Power epilepsy in my area
    - System Malfunctioning

- I sincerely apologized for the delayed submission, it was not due to any other reason but the above stated reasons.
