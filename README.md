## Lend-sqr assessment feedback by Awowole Hammad Olamilekan

### Tech stack used is majorly **React** A javaScript framework for design small and complex web applications.

## There are four figma design given to be done
- The login page
- The dashboard
- The user page and lastly
- The user details page

## The login page is the page where the user can login after successfully sign up, in this particular design, it was assumed that the user already sign up with an email: test@gmail.com and password test123@.
## I set my logic that only when the user login with the correct credentials should he be navigated to the dashboard otherwise an alert should pop out "Invalid user details".
## React UseState hook was used to update the state of the authentication

## The dashboard - This was divided into three components, the header, the sideboard and the userboard.
- The dasbboard was divided into many component not for any reason but for
    - code readability
    - code reuseability
- The UserData file is where i fetched my data from an API generated from json-generator.com then mocked the response body using Mocki.io as instructed in the instruction attached to the assessment question.
- I used asyn-await to fetch the data from the API as this enable the removal of .then() callbacks and in turns return an asynchronous resolved data. i used the await function to wait for the promise.

- The data fetch was dynamically rendered and displayed.

# Challenges face
- I applied last year december and was given a 7 days to submit the assessment but there are some challenges i faced that prevent me from submitting at the due date.
    - Power epilepsy: The first challenge was the abnormal state of the electricity in my area, its not encouraging at all.
    - System Malfunctioning

Lastly, I higly apologized for submiting my assessment late, it was not due to any other reason but the above stated reasons.
I understand that time management is very important which is one of my attributes, so i'm using this medium to apologized.
